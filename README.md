# anti-afk
Keeps your character logged in and circumvents AFK system and random disconnects that occur.

This script works in the background, so you can keep WoW running in the background while doing other things.

## requirements
https://www.autohotkey.com/

## how to use
1. (optional) character with macro bound to 1 to interact/cast a spell with a target e.g. Priest with a macro bound to 1
```
/target Hogger 
/cast mind vision
```
2. Logout macro bound to 2

```
/raid I am logging out on purpose! Brb 1min
/logout
```

Activate the wow client you wish to use it and then load the script.

When your character is ingame, you can press `ctrl+shift+F9` to enable or disable the script.

Over long periods of time your character may drift forwards slightly. So put yourself against a wall or in a corner.
